## Introduction
He is the balancer of our team.
He sometimes produces output with his development skills, sometimes organises the team members, sometimes adjusts specifications, sometimes thinks about bottlenecks against KPIs, etc. He thinks in his own way about ‘the moves we need to make as a team right now’ and moves on.
He also has a desire to be technically ambitious. He has been with us for a year and a half, almost as a rookie, but he has grown to the point where he can fight on the front line. He is not the type of person who pushes others or has good technical skills, so it is more like he has steadily built up his technical skills one by one, rather than exploding.
He has a good personality and a very good ability to relate to others. He is also able to listen to what people have to say and put it down and think about it himself.
It can take a little time, but his opinions are often spot-on.
